# Minimalist NixOS gaming machine.
#
# Design:
#
# - No desktop environment, no display manager, not even an X server. NixOS
#   boots to a plain TTY (getty) by default, so there is nothing to disable.
# - Steam cannot draw on a bare TTY -- it needs *a* display server. The
#   lightest one that works is gamescope, Valve's micro-compositor (the same
#   thing SteamOS runs), which drives the GPU directly via DRM/KMS.
# - Flow: boot -> getty auto-logs larry in on tty1 -> the login shell launches
#   `steam-gamescope` -> Steam Big Picture, with no input anywhere. Quitting
#   Steam ("Switch to Desktop" in Big Picture) drops to a logged-in shell on
#   tty1; logging out of it (Ctrl-D) brings Big Picture back.
#
# Install workflow:
#
# 1. Install NixOS normally (minimal ISO, see image/).
# 2. Clone this repo onto the machine. Overwrite hardware-configuration.nix
#    with the machine's real one, generated during install, and commit it:
#    `nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hardware-configuration.nix`
# 3. `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gaming`. (Once the hostname is set,
#    plain `--flake .` also works: it selects the config whose name matches
#    the hostname.)

  #   server, which mixes many apps' streams onto one device.
