# Minimalist NixOS gaming machine.
#
# Design:
#
# - No desktop environment, no display manager, not even an X server. NixOS
#   boots to a plain TTY (getty) by default, so there is nothing to disable.
# - Steam cannot draw on a bare TTY -- it needs *a* display server. The
#   lightest one that works is gamescope, Valve's micro-compositor (the same
#   thing SteamOS runs), which drives the GPU directly via DRM/KMS.
# - Flow: boot -> log in on the TTY -> run `steam-gamescope` -> Steam Big
#   Picture. Quitting Steam drops you back to the TTY.
#
# Install workflow:
#
# 1. Install NixOS normally (minimal ISO, see image/). `nixos-generate-config`
#    produces /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix (filesystems, microcode);
#    keep it.
# 2. Put this file at /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.
# 3. `nixos-rebuild switch`.
#
# TODO(larry): grep for "TODO" -- hostname, user password, SSH key, GPU
# driver, WiFi, and Bluetooth are placeholders pending hardware details.
