# Minimalist NixOS gaming machine.
#
# Design:
#
# - No desktop environment, no display manager, not even an X server. NixOS
#   boots to a plain TTY (getty) by default, so there is nothing to disable.
# - Steam cannot draw on a bare TTY -- it needs *a* display server. The
#   lightest one that works is gamescope, Valve's micro-compositor (the same
#   thing SteamOS runs), which drives the GPU directly via DRM/KMS.
# - Flow: boot -> log in on the TTY -> run `steam-gamescope` -> Steam Big
#   Picture. Quitting Steam drops you back to the TTY.
#
# Install workflow:
#
# 1. Install NixOS normally (minimal ISO, see image/).
# 2. Clone this repo onto the machine. Overwrite the placeholder
#    hardware-configuration.nix with the machine's real one, generated during
#    install, and commit it:
#    `nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hardware-configuration.nix`
# 3. `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gaming`. (Once the hostname is set,
#    plain `--flake .` also works: it selects the config whose name matches
#    the hostname.)

  #### Audio ###################################################################

  # - PulseAudio: a protocol that defines how apps talk to a userspace sound
  #   server, which mixes many apps' streams onto one device.
  # - PipeWire: the modern implementation of the PulseAudio protocol. It also
  #   re-implements the ALSA userspace API, catching apps that talk ALSA
  #   directly.
